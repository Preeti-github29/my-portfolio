        <p>
          Hi, I’m Preeti Kumari — a Senior Software Engineer with over 4 years of hands-on experience across enterprise IT, retail systems, and automation. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Georgia and am currently based in Atlanta, GA.

        <p>
          I embarked my professional journey in 2019 after completing my bachelor's with one of the top consulting firms, Mphasis, where I served as a dedicated Technical Support Engineer. In this role, I gained hands-on experience with ServiceNow, managing and resolving tickets, troubleshooting SQL queries using logs, and ensuring customer satisfaction through timely communication and resolution within SLA timelines. My strong performance led to a promotion as an Assistant Software Engineer, where one of my key accomplishments was automating the weekly reporting process—reducing manual intervention by 75%—and training colleagues on GitHub best practices.

          Throughout my career, I’ve built robust backend systems using Java and Python, streamlined ITSM workflows using ServiceNow, and created insightful dashboards with Tableau and Power BI. I've worked on high-impact projects involving POS system integration, handheld device upgrades, and automation for daily operations. I’ve also debugged and resolved complex L2/L3 technical issues using tools like Datadog and Bugsnag.

          To advance my career and explore better opportunities, I made a deliberate decision to step out of my comfort zone and pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Georgia, a prestigious institution known for its academic excellence. Being accepted into the program on my first attempt marked a significant milestone in my professional journey.

          During my time at the university, I had the privilege of working as a Graduate Teaching Assistant, which not only strengthened my communication skills but also allowed me to engage with students from diverse cultural and academic backgrounds.

          I contributed to projects focused on capacity planning report generation using Python libraries and executing ETL processes through AWS Glue, further expanding my expertise in cloud technologies and data engineering practices.

          What drives me is the challenge of turning inefficiencies into seamless workflows. Whether it’s enhancing in-store operations, optimizing resource planning, or simplifying UI interactions — I thrive on solving problems with practical, data-driven solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I build side projects like COVID forecasting models, Book Recommendation system and contribute to personal automation tools.
